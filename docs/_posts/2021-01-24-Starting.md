Ok, where should I start?

First off, some basic decisions: I'll start with the frontend, as
most of the features I have in mind won't really need a backend.

I simply created a "Hello World" react app using JSX and went from there.

To start, I'm going to build the foundational feature of the app:
selecting exercises from a list and adding them to the workout.

This begins by [showing a list of exercises](https://github.com/kewne/wod-builder/commit/9bc7301a01649d31b0a775bd911813a6ddc9079c), so I create a dummy
variable and inject that into a basic react list.
It's pretty quick and is enough to verify the app setup is working.

Then I [do two other things](https://github.com/kewne/wod-builder/commit/bfff8cd23a6214a2ddbf7eb5389f05479d01a461):
1. I convert the exercise list items into buttons, so the user can click them;
2. I introduce a component for listing the workout's exercises.

I put both components in the main app component and add the `workout`
state variable so they communicate.
An important thing I'm doing here is creating the `onSelect` handler prop
in the `ExercisePicker` component to allow for communication.
