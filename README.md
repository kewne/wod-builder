# WOD Builder

A browser app for building WODs (Workout Of the Day).

This is also a code story, which means that
the git log contains the explanations of what I'm
doing and why.
Besides seeing each commit in the Github site,
you can also read it with:

```
git log --grep='^Story:' --reverse -p
```

To run for development: `npm run dev-server`.
